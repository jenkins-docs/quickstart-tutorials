# This Dockerfile is used to create a Gitpod workspace with GitHub CLI installed.

# We start from the Gitpod full workspace image which includes a broad range of development tools.
FROM gitpod/workspace-full:2025-09-22-12-51-14

# The RUN command executes a series of commands in the new layer of the image and commits the results.
# The following commands are executed:

# 1. Check if curl is installed. If not, update the package list and install curl.
# 2. Download the GPG key for the GitHub CLI repository and save it to a specific location.
# 3. Change the permissions of the GPG key file to make it readable for all users.
# 4. Add the GitHub CLI repository to the list of APT sources.
# 5. Update the package list again to include packages from the newly added repository.
# 6. Install the GitHub CLI (gh).
# 7. Clean up the APT cache to reduce the size of the image.
# 8. Remove unnecessary files and directories to further reduce the size of the image.
